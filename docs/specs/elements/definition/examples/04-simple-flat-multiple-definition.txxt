1. Introduction

    This session contains multiple definitions that introduce the main topic. The definitions provide context and set up the discussion for the sections that follow.

    Parser :
        A program that analyzes text according to formal grammar rules to create a structured representation like an Abstract Syntax Tree.

    Lexer :
        A program that breaks down text into tokens, which are the smallest meaningful units of the language being processed.

2. Advanced Concepts

    AST :
        Abstract Syntax Tree - a tree representation of the syntactic structure of source code or text, where each node represents a construct occurring in the source.
	
    This session covers more advanced concepts with additional definitions.


    Compiler :
        A program that translates source code written in one programming language into another language, typically machine code or bytecode.
