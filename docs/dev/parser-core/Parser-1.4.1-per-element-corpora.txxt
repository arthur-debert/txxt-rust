We will plan the preparation for implementing the actual txxt parser.

It's key that we procce and vetto, before hand, most corpora sources. 
Those are explicit examples per document spec , that are machine identifiable tagged
While laboriouos, this ensure that we have a vettoedd an verified txxt source stirng foreach relevant testable ocurrence.

The ones with ** are best hanlded outisde the element spec (lest speci files become huge)

1. Valid Input
    a) All non container elements in their simple basic form.

                - With params
            - Lists: 
                - Mixed styling
                - Verify one list item only not a list
                - Verify that nested list with 1 item and inner with 1 item are ok
            - Params: 
                - Escaping
                - Unicode
                - Quoted Strings
                - Combinations fo thises
    c) Content Container flat element list
        - Group of paragrahs and blank lines.
        - Paragraphs and list
        - Paragraphs and annotation (preccding)
        - Varios flat combination. **
        - One master where multiple elements, and in their own complex versions **
    d) elements in their nested forms (using content container)
        - Nested Definitions
        - Nested Lists
        - Mixed Nested lists (styles)
        - Nested lists with content (like paragrap)
    e) Container nested (recusrive)
        - Simpler cases (all flat and one nested alement) 
        - More complicated ensable: nested lists multiple elements nested**
    f) Session Container in Flat Form
        - Session Title + 1 Child Paragraph
        - Session Title + 2 Child Paragraph
        - Session Title + Children of several elements (flat)
        - Multiple Sessions with : Session Title + 1 Child Paragraph 
        - Multiple Sessions with : Session Title + 2 Child Paragraph
        - Multiple Title + Children of several elements (flat) **
    g) Session Container in nested form
        - Session Title + child paragraph + innes session with title + child paragraph 
        - Session Title + Nested children  +  **
        - Session Title + Nested children  +  Nested sessions **
    h) Hard disabiguation edge-cases (to be decided) **
    i) Inline Elements in simple form (formatting, math)
        - One test for each of bold, italics, code and math.
        - Nested inlines (example _this and *that*_)
    j) Inline Elements in hard form
        - Several permutations with escape chars, unicode
    k) Inline Elements : References Simple

        - Citations, several forms
        - Footnotes both forms
    l) Inline Elements : References Complex
        - For each target type: 
            - Unicode

2) Invalid Input
    a) Labels
    b) Parameters
    c) Defintiions
    d) Annotations

    g) Nested Lists
    h) Lists with blank lines betwen elements alone
    i) Sessions with no content
    j) Indented content with no session title


3. Non spec related: 
    1. Setup dedicated corpora file infrastructure
    2. Create the specs


Task: go over each elment spec and corpora tag the samples above described, except fot he ensamble full files.
