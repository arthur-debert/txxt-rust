1. Main Topic

    This is the introduction to the main topic. It provides an overview before diving into specific subtopics.

    1.1. First Subtopic
    
        This subsection explores the first aspect of the main topic in detail. Notice how it is indented one level deeper than the main section.
        
        The second paragraph in this subsection provides additional context and examples.

    1.2. Second Subtopic
    
        This subsection covers the second aspect. The hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2) makes the structure clear.

            How deep does the rabbit hole go? This demonstrates the deepest level of nesting with paragraphs.

2. Another Main Topic

    This second main topic is at the same level as the first, demonstrating how nested and flat structures can combine.
