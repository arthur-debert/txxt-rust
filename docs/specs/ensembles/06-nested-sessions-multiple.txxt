Main Topic

    This is the introduction to the main topic. It provides an overview before diving into specific subtopics.

    First Subtopic
    
        This subsection explores the first aspect of the main topic in detail. Notice how it is indented one level deeper than the main section.

        And this is a continuation with the paragraph element.
        
    Second Subtopic
    
        This subsection covers the second aspect. The hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2) makes the structure clear.

        And one of the sessions will be three level deep.

        Third Subtopic

            How deep does the rabit whole goes?

Another Main Topic

    This second main topic is at the same level as the first, demonstrating how nested and flat structures can combine.
