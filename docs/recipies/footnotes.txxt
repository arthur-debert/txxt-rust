Reference Notes (Footnotes)

    Txxt supports footnote-style references, which are common in academic and technical writing. This is achieved through a special reference syntax that links to items in the final section of a document.

1. Syntax

    A footnote-style reference is a "naked numerical reference"â€”an inline reference [../70-refs.txxt] that contains only a number.

    `[<number>]`

    The parser interprets this as a shorthand for `[#-1.<number>]`, which creates a link to the corresponding numbered item in the last section of the document. 

2. Convention

    By convention, the last section in a document serves as the container for notes, citations, or references. This section is often titled "Notes," "Footnotes," or "References", but txxt doesn't enforce it.

3. Example

    -- An example of reference notes
        This is a statement that needs a citation[1]. Another point needs a different one[2].

        Notes

            1. This is the first citation, providing source details.
            2. This is the second citation, expanding on the point.
    -- txxt

    In this example:
    - `[1]` in the text creates a link using the reference syntax [../70-refs.txxt].
    - It points to the item beginning with `1.` in the "Notes" section, because "Notes" is the last section in the document.
    - This mechanism allows authors to create standard footnotes without introducing new syntax, relying instead on a clean and intuitive convention.

The footnote items themselves are formatted as an ordered list [../30-lists.txxt], following standard list alignment rules [../02-alignment.txxt].

This convention is demonstrated in practice in [../intro.txxt], which uses footnote references.
