1. Complex Document Structure

    This document demonstrates deep nesting with multiple element types at various levels.

    1.1. First Major Subsection
    
        This subsection contains a nested list with its own content:
        
        - Top level list item with nested content
            - First nested item
            - Second nested item
                1. Numbered sub-item
                2. Another numbered sub-item
        - Second top level item
        
        Following the list, we have a definition:
        
        Nested Definition:
            This definition appears within a subsection, showing how definitions can be placed at any level of the document hierarchy.
            
    1.2. Second Major Subsection
    
        This subsection demonstrates even deeper nesting.
        
        1.2.1. Third Level Section
        
            Content at the third level of nesting. This shows that txxt supports arbitrary nesting depth.
            
            Key concepts:
            - Depth is indicated by indentation
            - Each level is exactly 4 spaces deeper
            - Structure remains clear even at deep levels

2. Conclusion

    This final section wraps up the complex document, demonstrating how flat and nested structures coexist.
