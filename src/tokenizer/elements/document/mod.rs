//! Document-level element tokenization
//!
//! Implements tokenization for document-level elements as defined in
//! docs/specs/elements/document.txxt
//!
//! Document elements handle the overall structure and metadata of TXXT documents.
//! This includes document headers, metadata, and root-level organization.

// Document-level tokenization will be implemented here
// Currently, document structure is handled implicitly through containers
// and other elements, but specific document-level tokens may be added here.
