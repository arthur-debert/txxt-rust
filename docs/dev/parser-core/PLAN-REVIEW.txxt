Parser Master Plan Review

Analysis of the current master plan for parser implementation with recommendations.

1. Plan Assessment

    1.1. Overall Structure: Excellent
    
        ✅ Clear progression: Prep → Implementation → Reference Data
        ✅ Progressive complexity: Simple → Complex
        ✅ Systematic coverage: Valid → Invalid → Edge cases
        ✅ Proper isolation: Element by element, then combinations
        
    1.2. Key Strengths
    
        - Incremental approach prevents big-bang failures
        - Test-driven with corpora foundation
        - Tooling before implementation (inspection, assertions)
        - Clear completion criteria (all tests passing)
        - Proper git workflow (PRs, issues, commits)

2. Completeness Analysis

    2.1. What's Good (Keep As-Is)
    
        ✅ Section 1: Preparatory Work
            - AST capabilities complete (1.1.1, 1.1.2)
            - Inspection tools defined (1.2)
            - Assertion framework planned (1.3)
            - Dataset generation complete (1.4)
            
        ✅ Section 2: Parser Implementation structure
            - Progressive valid input coverage (2.1.1 → 2.1.10)
            - Systematic invalid input testing (2.2)
            - Document ensemble validation (2.3)
            
        ✅ Section 3: Reference Data Generation
            - Validated corpus expansion
            
        ✅ Rules Section
            - Clear PR naming and workflow
            - Issue tracking requirements
    
    2.2. What's Missing (Should Add)
    
        Missing from current plan:
        
        1.3.3. Illustrated test examples
            Purpose: Show developers how to write parser tests
            Deliverable: Example test file with inline documentation
            
        2.0. Parser Architecture Setup
            2.0.1. Parser infrastructure and error types
            2.0.2. Pipeline integration points
            Rationale: Need foundation before element parsing
            
        2.1.0. Block grouping validation
            Purpose: Validate indentation-based grouping works
            Rationale: Foundation for all element parsing
            
        2.4. Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation
            2.4.1. Fallback to paragraph on ambiguity
            2.4.2. Partial parse recovery
            Rationale: Spec mentions graceful degradation
            
        3.2. Language Server Preparation
            3.2.1. Position mapping verification
            3.2.2. Range calculation validation
            Rationale: LSP will need accurate positions
    
    2.3. What Should Be Refined
    
        Current: "2.1.2 Isolated element, complex form"
        Appears twice (line 37, 38) - second should be numbered 2.1.3
        
        Current: "2.1.10 Reference Targets Complex"
        Duplicate number (appears as both 2.1.10 and 2.1.10)
        Should be: 2.1.11
        
        Current: "2.3.1 Simple doc properties"
        Duplicate (appears twice on lines 58, 59)
        Should be: 2.3.1 and 2.3.2

3. Recommended Additions

    3.1. Add Before Parser Implementation
    
        1.5. Developer Tooling
            1.5.1. Developer cheatsheet for parser implementation
            1.5.2. Test writing guide with examples
            1.5.3. Debugging helpers and utilities
            
        Rationale: Helps developers implement consistently
        
    3.2. Add to Parser Implementation
    
        2.0. Parser Foundation (before 2.1)
            2.0.1. Parser infrastructure setup
            2.0.2. Error type definitions
            2.0.3. Block grouping validation
            
        Rationale: Need foundation before element parsing

    3.3. Add After Implementation
    
        4. Performance and Optimization
            4.1. Benchmark suite using ensemble documents
            4.2. Memory profiling
            4.3. Performance regression detection
            
        Rationale: Ensure parser scales well

4. Numbering Corrections

    Current issues:
    - Line 37-38: "2.1.2" appears twice
    - Line 46-47: "2.1.10" appears twice  
    - Line 58-59: "2.3.1" appears twice
    
    Suggested renumbering:
        2.1.1. Isolated element, simpler form
        2.1.2. Container Elements: flat
        2.1.3. Isolated element, complex form
        2.1.4. Container Elements: nested
        2.1.5. Elements, nested, complex
        2.1.6. Session Container: flat
        2.1.7. Session Container: nested
        2.1.8. Hard Edge Cases
        2.1.9. Inline Elements, Simple (except References)
        2.1.10. Inline Elements, Complex (except References)
        2.1.11. Reference Targets Simple
        2.1.12. Reference Targets Complex
        
        2.3.1. Simple doc properties
        2.3.2. Annotation Attachment

5. Recommendations Summary

    5.1. Critical (Must Do)
    
        - Fix numbering duplicates (2.1.2, 2.1.10, 2.3.1)
        - Add 2.0 Parser Foundation section
        - Add 1.5 Developer Tooling section
        
    5.2. Important (Should Do)
    
        - Add 2.4 Error Recovery section
        - Add 1.3.3 Illustrated test examples
        - Add 3.2 Language Server Preparation
        
    5.3. Nice to Have (Could Do)
    
        - Add Section 4 for Performance
        - Add integration test milestones
        - Add refactoring/cleanup phase

6. Overall Assessment

    Rating: 8.5/10
    
    Strengths:
    - Excellent incremental structure
    - Good test coverage planning
    - Clear milestones and deliverables
    - Proper tooling emphasis
    
    Areas for improvement:
    - Fix numbering duplicates
    - Add parser foundation section
