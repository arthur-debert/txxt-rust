:: description :: Examples annotated with expected AST structure for auto-validation

1. Definition with ContentContainer (listItem)

    Basic Definition ::
        A definition uses ContentContainer to hold its content.
        This allows for consistent structure across all indented content.

    Definition with List ::
        Definitions can contain multiple block types:
        - Paragraphs (listItem)
        - Lists like this one (listItem)
        - Even nested definitions (listItem)
        
        All wrapped in a ContentContainer.

2. Multiline Annotations with ContentContainer (listItem)

    :: note ::
        This is a multiline annotation.
        It uses ContentContainer for its content.
        
        Just like definitions, it can have multiple paragraphs.

    :: warning:severity=high ::
        Critical warning with parameters.
        The ContentContainer holds all the content.

3. Nested Structures (listItem)

    Complex Definition ::
        This definition contains nested structures.
        
        Inner Definition ::
            Nested definitions work as expected.
            Each has its own ContentContainer.
        
        Back to the outer definition content.
